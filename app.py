**Kembang Goyang - Historical Insight**  
Kembang Goyang, known as a traditional Betawi snack, has fascinating origins beyond Indonesian shores. This flower-shaped rice flour snack, fried with a shaking motion (hence "goyang"), shares similarities with Norway's krumkake‚Äîa Viking-era dessert. 

The snack is believed to have been introduced through Portuguese influence in the 19th century and was gradually adapted by locals. It has now become a staple in Betawi celebrations, reflecting cultural fusion and historical culinary journeys.

Over time, it became accessible to all social classes. In the 1970s, it began being sold around the National Monument (Monas) and was promoted by Jakarta's governor Ali Sadikin.
